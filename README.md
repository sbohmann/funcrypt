A weak symmetric cipher modeled modeled after 20th century ciphers, using a Feistel network.

Please do not attempt to make it stronger by increasing number of rounds or internal rounds, block length, or key length. Any such attempt will only make it slower but not more secure.

Only ciphers peer-reviewed and researched over at least a decade can provide any reasonable level of security.

This one is not, nor would it stand any chance against such reviews and research.

This is not a real cipher ðŸ˜…

But it is very easy to understand ðŸ¤©
